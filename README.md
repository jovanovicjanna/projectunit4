# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Description
My client is a student at a local school. After meeting with her (see Appendix A), I discovered that she is interested in exploring new makeup brands and products. She is new to the industry and doesn’t know where to begin or how to know the real quality of the product. Currently, she is exploring her area of interest through various social media apps but the information is too disorganized as it does not guide viewers to each page. Other social networks are not well-established communities concentrated just on makeup and she is not able to learn from people who know more than she does and view their reviews on products. Moreover, she would like to make reviews of the makeup she tries and share her experience with others.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution
## Design statement
I will design and make a social network for a client who is a student at a local school. The social network will be about sharing reviews of makeup products and is constructed using the software Python. It will take 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria listed below.

## Criteria for Success
1. The social network has a login and register system *[issue tackled=” Other social networks ”]*
2. The user must be able to input their own reviews of a product, rate it, and delete it. *[issue tackled=Moreover, she would like to make reviews of the makeup she tries and share her experience with others.]*
3. Users must be able to view the review posted by other users. *[issue tackled = she is not able to learn from people who know more than she does and view their reviews on products.]*
4. Users must be able to view basic statistics [*issue tackled =  Other social networks are not well-established communities ]*
5. Users must be able to like reviews posted by other users. *[issue tackled = Other social networks are not well-established communities concentrated just on makeup.]*
6. The social network includes a top navigation bar that is visible on pages so it guides users to each page. *[issue tackled = Currently, she is exploring her area of interest through various social media apps but the information is too disorganized as it does not guide viewers to each page]*
